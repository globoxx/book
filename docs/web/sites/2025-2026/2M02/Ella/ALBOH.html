			<h2>The (Very Slightly Offbeat) History of Thanksgiving</h2>
			<p>Thanksgiving: that magical time of year when we gather, stuff ourselves with food, and then nap it off while pretending we’re not already thinking about Christmas. But where did this glorious holiday even come from? Let's take a quick (and highly unofficial) stroll through history.</p>

				<h2>The Pilgrims & The “First Thanksgiving” (aka, the Original Potluck)</h2>
				<p>In 1621, a group of Pilgrims from England landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts, eager to escape religious persecution and, you know, start a new life in the wilderness. Spoiler alert: they had no idea what they were doing. Thankfully, the Wampanoag people were like, “Hey, we’ve got this whole surviving-in-the-wild thing down. Let us help!” The Pilgrims accepted, and they all sat down to a feast that probably didn’t involve turkey, but definitely had a lot of venison, corn, and whatever else they could find (probably no pumpkin pie, but we can dream).</p>

				<h2>The Turkey, the Bird (the Only Reason <b>We</b> Celebrate Thanksgiving)</h2>
				<p>Fast forward to modern-day, and Thanksgiving is all about family, gratitude, and eating way more than any human should in one sitting. Oh, and the turkey. The bird that was probably only kind of part of the first Thanksgiving is now the undisputed centerpiece of the holiday. The debate has been raised about what the best part of the meal is and the answer, of course, is always turkey (and the stuffing)—unless you’re just here for Julian's Parisbrest, you know who you are</p>
