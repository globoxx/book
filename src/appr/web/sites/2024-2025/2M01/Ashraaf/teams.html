                    <p>After being bought his first go-kart by his Dad, Lewis starts karting competitively and collects multiple race wins across different British cadet races and championships.</p>

                    <p>Fourteen podiums, five of them wins, see Lewis crowned GP2 champion at the first attempt.

                    <p>A first F1 Drivers’ Championship is claimed in dramatic style at the final race of the year, to become one of the sport’s youngest champions. Five wins are enough to help seal glory, the highlight of which comes at Silverstone, as Lewis finishes nearly 70 seconds clear of the field in front of his home crowd.</p>

Lewis also wins BBC Sports Personality of the Year for the first time too.</p>

                    <p>Off the track Lewis launches his first fashion line, Lewis x Tommy, with Tommy Hilfiger. On it, he becomes a five-time world champion, fending off the challenge of Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel.

At the end of the season, the Team launch its Accelerate 25 initiative aimed at increasing diversity and inclusion in motorsport.</p>

                    <p>One year on from his epic victory at Interlagos, Lewis attended a special ceremony at the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia, where he receives honorary citizenship of Brasil. “I really want to dedicate today, this honour, to Ayrton Senna – to Ayrton’s family, to his friends and to his fans.
